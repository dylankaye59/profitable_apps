    "It seems that with most of the genres there are a few apps in each that skew the data of the average number of ratings, we saw this trend earlier in the 3 genres with the highest average user ratings. You see this in the `Games` genre with the apps `Clash of Clans` and `Temple Run`, the `Music` genre with `Pandora` and `Spotify`, and the `Navigation` genre with `Waze` and `Google Maps`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now while there are some genres which do not have apps with user ratings that total over 100,000, they do however have very few apps in their category and it can be seen that their most popular apps have much less user ratings than other popular apps in other genres. This can be seen in the genre `Medical` with the apps `Snorelab` and `Blink Health` which have `1341` and `11981` respectively, `Catalogs` with `CPlus` and `DRAGONS MODS` which have `13345` and `2027` respectively, `Business` with `Indeed` and `Flashlight` which have `38681` and `24744`respectively. So while there would be less competition if we were to design apps for these genres, from looking at their popularity the potential for profitability is far less and so we will avoid these genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to develop for genres that have a high potential for profitability but are not overly saturated with too many apps, as that would make it hard to break into the market due to high levels of competition. Earlier in the project we analysed the percentage of the total apps that each genre had on the App Store, with `Games` making up `58.16%` and `Entertainment` making up `7.88%`. For these genres we should avoid developing our app for, but we could incorporate features from these genres into our app idea as they are popular but instead have our apps primary focus be elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously most of the genres contain a few popular apps that skew their data, so unless we want to develop an app for a genre that has a very small market and so low profitability, we need to make a compromise. Looking at the above data we want to select genres that have their total user ratings more spread out over their apps, where there is less domination by a few popular apps and so gives us a better chance to break into said market. We also want genres that are not oversaturated with apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genres that look promising in this regard are:\n",
    "* `Book`\n",
    "* `Shopping`\n",
    "* `Sports`\n",
    "* `Productivity`\n",
    "* `Utilities`\n",
    "* `Education`\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an idea of the total market share that each of the above genres has on the App Store for free English apps we will create the function `total_genre_rating` and use it to calculate the total amount of user ratings for a genre (and so the genres popularity and its share of the store market), and calculate the percentage that this genre total is of the App Stores combined user ratings. We have done this in the code below and demonstrated the results for each genre:"

    "Of the six genres we can see that `Shopping` holds the highest market share with `2.83%` of the total user ratings, and `Book` holds the least at `0.7%`. It interesting to note that although the `Book` genre has the lowest market share it does have the highest average user ratings per app at `39758.5` compared to the other 5 genres. In the output below you can see that this is being cause by a few apps that hold the majority of the total user ratings for the `Book` genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Utilities` - Includes various calculators, flashlights, web browsers ect. Many of the apps that fit into this category would not be used for long lengths of time such as the alarm clock and QR reader, ideally we want to design an app that can retain a user for longer periods of times so there is higher chance of said user engaging with our ads. Designing a internet browser as well requires alot of time and monetary investment, and so would be out of the scope of our company.\n",
    "* `Book` - Of all the genres we are looking at for an app profile this one has the least amount of apps but the highest average number of ratings. This is due to the genre having a few apps with a high number of user ratings. Trying to compete with the dominating apps such as `Kindle` and `Audible` would be very difficult as these apps have large companies with great financial backing. There purpose, one to be a library of books and the other to offer the same but in an audio format, would be almost impossible to supplant as there isnt much else to innovate on.\n",
    "    * For this genre we need to get more creative if we wanted to stand out. The `Hooked` and `Color Therapy Adult Coloring Book for Adults` each take unique approaches and its apparent how they have managed to stand out amongst this genre. Like the `Hooked` app we can focus on fan-fiction or user created content, and include networking opportunites for the users incorporating aspects of apps from the `Social Media` genre. We can have it so users can upload their own source material. We can then have ads displaced on the user interface outside and inside texts.\n",
    "* `Education` - Here we see a mix of game-style education apps such as `Elevate`, apps designed for educational instituions such as `canvas` and learning apps such as `duolingo`. This genre has potential for high user retention as we can implement learning paths alongside a course structure, however this would best be aimed at a younger audience as focusing on specialist subjects or older audiences could potentially require educational specialists to come up with the material for the app and so could prove to be costly. \n",
    "    * Having a learning path with multiple lessons and modules would give us the opportunity to display ads within the app. We could include weekly challenges if we decide to include gaming elements, that could explore the topics and subject we decide to include. This could help with user retention as it provide fresh materials for user to come back to.\n",
    "* `Productivity` - This genre appears to focus on 'office' style apps such as `Gmail` and `Microsoft Word`. Now while alot of these types of apps would tend to be used more frequently and potentially multiple times a day, it appears that this market is dominated by a few companies with lots of popular apps.\n",
    "    * However when looking at what types of apps that dominate the App Store it is clear the apps designed for \"fun\" take this spot over \"work\" or \"office\" apps. You can see this with the `Games` genre taking up `53.39%` of all the user ratings for the app store. Designing a app that would fit the `Productivity` genre may give us a chance to stand out on the app store as a whole as it is oversaturated with \"fun\" apps.\n",
    "    * As the genre is dominated by office apps we can design an app that employs 'gamification' to help it stand out amongst the other apps. We could include elements like a task manager and planner that would include earning points for unlocks or achievements based on meeting set goals and completing tasks. \n",
    "* `Sports` - Consists of many apps belonging to large sport news networks and fantasy sport leagues. Developing an app for reporting sports news would require potentially hiring extra staff to take the roles of writers, reporters or entertainers. It would be a big undertaking that prove to be very costly. \n",
    "    * We could look at developing a fantasy sport leagues app, this would not require the expensive overheads that a news network could entail. We can easily embed a social networking function and allow users to set up leagues with their friends so as to encourages users to participate with others online and to get them to encourage people they know to get the app. \n",
    "    * `Social Networking` is a popular genre and accounts for `9.48%` of the user ratings of free english apps of the App Store, and so taking some ideas of what makes that genre popular and applying it to our more niche market could help us stand out. \n",
    "    * We could include quizzes and trivia games about various sport related topics. We can also include a sports reference guide that would alow users to search current and past information about players, teams, tournaments ect. depending on the sport. Including these aspects that you would most likely find in the `Games` and `Reference` genres can keep user retainment and engagement for longer as they will not have to use any external apps to search up relevant information for sports teams and for related sports trivia games.\n",
    "* `Shopping` - Apps here are often online stores which would require purchasing and delivering inventory which be outside the scope of our company. While apps like`eBay` are free to use and sign up the primary revenues comes from eBay taking a cut of the profits from sellers and auctioneers. This ultimately goes against the aims we have set out for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I have created a funtion called `list_app_ratings` showing the apps and their user ratings for the list 6 genres above. This was for analysis and to show a comparison."

    "The `COMICS` genre has quite a low average installs per app at `817,657`. While there might be some opportunity here due to less competition from bigger developers, the potential for profitability would be less compared to the other genres listed above. However the idea of an app we have suggested for the `Book` Genre on the App Store could be replicated for the `COMICS` genre where instead the app can focus on user created comics and graphic novels. The same idea with users networking with each other and sharing their created works. This type of app would also fit under the `Book` genre on the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `EDUCATION` genre's apps all have less than 50 million installs. This means compared to other genres we would be competing against less dominating apps. With an average of `1,833,495` installs per app we could see better profitability than with the `LIBRARIES_AND_DEMO` and `COMIC` genres. As was the case with the App Store we see the same types of apps here with game-style education apps, utility apps designed for educational institutions or environments, and strictly learning based on such topics as programming, foreign languages and maths. As with the App Store we can draw the same conclusions for this genre by looking to develop a gamification educational app that aims for a younger audience or those with a lower overall level of education. This can help us stand out amongst the apps in this genre, as it appears to be filled with 'brain training/cogntive games' or straight up course and module structured learning apps. There is not really a blending of the two in this genre.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As with the `Game` genre being oversaturated on the App Store we decided not to investigate it for the Google Play Store either. For the same reasons is why we will not be looking to develop an app for the `FAMILY` genre as it looks to be for game apps aimed at children. It also suffers the same problem as with the `GAME` genre with it containing lots of apps (`1675` in this case) that do not get much traction and so it would be harder for us to compete within this genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SPORTS` genre has far more apps than it does on the App Store, it also includes gaming apps as well that are focused on sports such as `PES CLUB MANAGER` and `EA SPORTS UFC`. While the App Store's genre had `69` apps, the Google Play Store contains `301` suggesting a potential for more competition on this store. There also appears to be only 2 apps within this genre that have over 100 million installs and when these are removed the average installs per app drops from `3,638,640` to `2,994,083`. Compared to other genres on the Google Play Store this is a good result as we will have less big competitors to deal with. Within the App Store there are fantasy league sports apps, this si also the case in the Google Play Store as well, and as suggested on our analysis of this genre for the App Store we will need to innovate and add extra features to stand out amongst the fantasy league sports apps. As noted before because of the way that Google Play Store has decided to categorise sports gaming apps, under this genre, we will be competing with them for this market. Though by focusing the gaming aspects on party activites such as trivia and quizzes it can offer something different to what the core gaming apps offer in this genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the `BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE` genre on we can already see that there are considerably more apps (190) than with the `Books` (14 apps) and the `Reference` (18 apps) genres combined on the App Store. What this can mean is that developing an app for this genre may prove to be more profitable on the App Store, by virtue of there being less competiton, than on the Google Play Store. For the Google Play Store there also appears to be more apps designed to be dictionaires and far more apps dedicated to a single book, there are quite a few that have been for the Quran for example. For this genre there are only 5 apps that have over 100 million installs, however there is a signifcant decrease in average installs per app when these apps are removed from `8,767,811` to `1,437,212`. Here we are also seeing some apps that are skewing the popularity of this genre. For this genre like on the App Store, `BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE`has libraries that are the most popular apps in the genre. As discussed previously having an app focusing a user created content with social/forum functions can help us stand out in this genre. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `PRODUCTIVITY` has the second most amount of apps for the 6 genres we have selected for potential app profiles above at `345`. This, like most of the other genres we have looked at for further analysis, is a considerably higher amount of apps than what is contained in the `Productivity` genre on the App Store at `56`. Here on the Google Play Store we can also see that this genre is much more popular, being the 5th most popular, but on the App Store this is not the case with the genre being in the bottom half in terms of popularity. We can see that are `22` apps in this genre on the Google Play Store that have over 100 million installs which certainly skew the popularity as when these are removed the average installs drops from `16,787,331` to `3,379,657`. However when we look at the apps that are popular on the Google PLay Store not all of them are as popular on the App Store. This could potentially be due to the user ratings of the App Store not working as general tool for popularity, as perhaps users of apps from the `Productivity` genre are less likely to rate those apps than with other genres. Here for designing an app we would also be facing more competition on the Google Play Store due to the higher number of apps present in this genre in comparison to the App Store. We could be facing a similar issue in terms of profitability like as discussed with the `BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE` genre. Much like with the App Store this genre is dominated by 'office' apps and developing a gamification office app would help it to stand out."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We set out on this project to find a profitable app profile that can be used across both the Google Play Store and the App Store. As our main source of revenue would come from in app advertisements we wanted to look at the data of free english apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we found is that they are multiple avenues that we can approach when designing a profitable app. Genres which seem to have potential across both stores are productivity, books and reference (books for Google Play Store), sports, and education. We wanted to develop apps for more practical purposes rather than entertainment or 'fun' due to the oversaturation of such genres as `GAME` and `Games`. This is refelected in the genres we decided to come up with app recommendations for.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the genres we investigated further for potential app profiles, we noticed that the majority of their Google Play Store equivalents had more apps. We have noted that this could mean that app we develop may end up performing better on the App Store due to less competition. However, as noted in our validation strategy we will be building the app for the Google Play Store first so we should be able to circumvent this issue."
